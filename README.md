# Bricks

As usual, much of my time is lost on reinventing the wheel, especially when
starting a new project. So here's another project. Now focussing on those
bricks in the wall that make up parts of a project. This with the hope is

Doing some research for the following corner stones;

1. Logging
2. Configuration
3. Signals
4. ...
